## Introduction

Power TAC is a competitive simulation designed to support the study of retail electric power markets, especially as they relate to managing distributed renewable power sources. For more information, see http://www.powertac.org.

## Getting Started 



Go to the Power TAC developer's wiki at
https://github.com/powertac/powertac-server/wiki for information on design, development, and deployment of the Power TAC simulation server.

## PowerTAC Continuous Integration Server

PowerTAC is automatically built by Travis CI on new commits and pull requests. Furthermore, maven reports are generated for
releases (tags) and commits to the master branch. These reports can subsequently be found at

https://powertac.github.io/index.html

These reports include the JavaDocs, at

https://powertac.github.io/master/apidocs/index.html  (replace `master` with a specific tag if you want a particular release).

## Module structure

This is a multi-module structure, using maven for dependency management and build automation, and using git submodules to tie the pieces together and help create the correct directory structure in a development environment. This module is the root. It contains the parent pom, and the core server module. Other modules include [server-interface](https://github.com/powertac/server-interface), [accounting](https://github.com/powertac/accounting), [auctioneer](https://github.com/powertac/auctioneer), [default-broker](https://github.com/powertac/default-broker), [distribution-utility](https://github.com/powertac/distribution-utility), [genco](https://github.com/powertac/genco), and [household-customer](https://github.com/powertac/household-customer).

To populate a development environment, simply clone this repo, then populate the submodules. You can do this with `submodule init` followed by `submodule update` (the [Pro Git](http://progit.org/book/ch6-6.html) book has a good overview), or you can use the script `src/main/scripts/submodule-setup.sh`, which lets you specify a remote and branch (typically `origin` and `master`). Note that the submodule definitions are contained in the file `.gitmodules` that the current version of that file contains read-only urls for the modules, and that those may be out-of-date. If you plan to work on the code, you can simply change the URL for an individual module, as in `git remote set-url origin git@github.com:powertac/auctioneer.git`.

To update your development environment, you can always do

` git submodule foreach git pull origin master`

Note that some modules, such as common and the Sample Broker, are not submodules of powertac-server. If you need sources for those, you will need to pull them down separately.
